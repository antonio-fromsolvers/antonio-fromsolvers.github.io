In the auto bet, numerous tools are available to generate custom bets. By using this feature, you can enable a series of additional options that expand your playing possibilities. Below, we will detail these options:

- **Bet**: First, select the amount you want to bet.

- **Number of Rounds**: Decide how many rounds you want to play.

- **Auto cash out**: These functions are identical to those defined in the **"Auto Cash out"** section.

- **Stop on Profit**: This option allows you to set a target profit amount "x". The profit is calculated as the sum of your winnings minus the sum of your bets up to that point. If you reach or exceed this value at any time during the "n" rounds played, the bet will stop, even if there are still rounds left to play.

  **Example**: Let's say you have decided to play 10 rounds and have set a **"stop on profit"** limit of 15. Up to the third round, your results are as follows:

  \- Round 1: Bet 10, Cash out 13 (multiplier of 1.3)

  \- Round 2: Bet 10, Cash out 15 (multiplier of 1.5)

  \- Round 3: Round 3: Bet 10, Cash out 17 (multiplier of 1.7)

  At this point, you have accumulated a total win of **45**, and your total bets amount to 30. The net profit to compare is **45 - 30 = 15**, which is equal to or greater than the set limit of **15**. As a result, auto bets will stop automatically. This allows you to secure your winnings and exercise effective control over your game.

- **Stop on Loss**: Similar to the previous option, this option allows you to set a target loss amount "x". The loss is calculated as the sum of your bets up to that point minus the sum of your winnings. If your loss reaches or exceeds this value at any time during the "n" rounds played, the bet will stop, regardless of how many rounds are left to play.

  **Example**: Suppose you have chosen to play 10 rounds and have set a **"stop on loss"** limit of 5. Up to the second round, your results are as follows:

  \- Round 1: Bet 10, Cash out 13 (multiplier of 1.3)

  \- Round 2: Bet 10, Cash out 0 (loss)

  At this point, you have accumulated a total win of **13**, and your total bets amount to **20**. The net loss to compare is **20 - 13 = 7**, which is equal to or greater than the set limit of **5**. As a result, auto bets will stop automatically. This allows you to limit your losses and maintain effective control over your game responsibly.

- **On Win**: By enabling this option, you can increase or decrease the bet amount by a specific percentage if you win your previous bet.

  ![On Win](info/en/English_auto_bet_7.png)

  **Example**: Suppose you initially bet **100** and win the bet. If you have set a **"On Win, increase 10%"**, your next bet will be **110** (10% more than the previous bet). If you win again, your next bet will be **121** (10% more than the previous bet). This adjustment allows you to capitalize on your winning streaks by gradually increasing your bets and potentially increasing your winnings.

- **On Loss**: Similar to the previous option, you can increase or decrease the bet amount by a specific percentage if you lose your previous bet.

  ![On Loss](info/en/English_auto_bet_8.png)

  **Example**: Imagine that you initially bet **100** and lose the bet. If you have set a **"On Loss, decrease 20%"**, your next bet will be **80** (20% less than the previous bet). If you continue to lose, the next bet will be **64** (20% less than the previous bet). This adjustment allows you to reduce your bets when facing losses and preserve your capital, which can help you manage your losses more effectively.

It's important to note that **if you choose to play a specific number of rounds, you must select at least one type of auto cash out.** These options provide greater control over your bets and strategies in scheduled cash outs. Have fun and play responsibly!
